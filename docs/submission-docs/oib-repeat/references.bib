  abstract = {Spatio-temporal variations of the recently determined accumulation rate are investigated using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements and firn-core studies. The study area is located on Ritscherflya in western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, at an elevation range 1400\textendash 1560 m. Accumulation rates are derived from internal reflection horizons (IRHs), tracked with GPR, which are connected to a dated firn core. GPR-derived internal layer depths show small relief along a 22 km profile on an ice flowline. Average accumulation rates are about 190 kg m-2 a-1 (1980\textendash 2005) with spatial variability (1{$\sigma$}) of 5\% along the GPR profile. The interannual variability obtained from four dated firn cores is one order of magnitude higher, showing 1{$\sigma$} standard deviations around 30\%. Mean temporal variations of GPRderived accumulation rates are of the same magnitude or even higher than spatial variations. Temporal differences between 1980\textendash 90 and 1990\textendash 2005, obtained from two dated IRHs along the GPR profile, indicate temporally non-stationary processes, linked to spatial variations. Comparison with similarly obtained accumulation data from another coastal area in central Dronning Maud Land confirms this observation. Our results contribute to understanding spatio-temporal variations of the accumulation processes, necessary for the validation of satellite data (e.g. altimetry studies and gravity missions such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)).},

  abstract = {Despite considerable advances in process understanding, numerical modeling, and the observational record of ice sheet contributions to global mean sea-level rise (SLR) since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, severe limitations remain in the predictive capability of ice sheet models. As a consequence, the potential contributions of ice sheets remain the largest source of uncertainty in projecting future SLR. Here, we report the findings of a structured expert judgement study, using unique techniques for modeling correlations between inter- and intra-ice sheet processes and their tail dependences. We find that since the AR5, expert uncertainty has grown, in particular because of uncertain ice dynamic effects. For a +2 \textdegree C temperature scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement, we obtain a median estimate of a 26 cm SLR contribution by 2100, with a 95th percentile value of 81 cm. For a +5 \textdegree C temperature scenario more consistent with unchecked emissions growth, the corresponding values are 51 and 178 cm, respectively. Inclusion of thermal expansion and glacier contributions results in a global total SLR estimate that exceeds 2 m at the 95th percentile. Our findings support the use of scenarios of 21st century global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning purposes. Beyond 2100, uncertainty and projected SLR increase rapidly. The 95th percentile ice sheet contribution by 2200, for the +5 \textdegree C scenario, is 7.5 m as a result of instabilities coming into play in both West and East Antarctica. Introducing process correlations and tail dependences increases estimates by roughly 15\%.},

The ice cores were dated based on annual layer counting of multiple glaciochemical measurements resulting in bottom depth ages for WDC05A, WDC05Q, and ITASE 00-1 of 1775, 1521, and 1653 A.D., with mean annual accumulation rates of 0.200, 0.204, and 0.221 mweq a-1, respectively. Small-scale spatial variability (SSV) was determined using an analysis of variance of accumulation in the ice core array, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in individual accumulation records. Results indicate that the spatial variability was 0.030 mweq a-1, or approximately 15\% of the average annual accumulation. An accumulation record representative of the WAIS Divide local area over recent centuries was developed using a principal component analysis to identify the coherent accumulation signal. The WAIS Divide local record exhibited 14\% interannual variability (1 standard deviation of the mean) with the SSV reduced to 0.017 mweq a-1. Correlations of the WAIS Divide local accumulation record with atmospheric indices (e.g., Antarctic Oscillation) exhibited periods when the records oscillate in and out of phase. Thus, reconstructing local and global atmospheric indices from WAIS Divide accumulation records over recent centuries may prove problematic.},

  abstract = {Observations of snow accumulation rates from five new firn cores show a negative trend that is statistically significant over the past several decades across the central West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). A negative temporal trend in accumulation rates is unexpected in light of rising surface temperatures as well as model simulations predicting higher accumulation rates for the region. Both the magnitude of the mean accumulation rates and the range of interannual variability observed in the new records compare favorably to older records collected from a broad area of the WAIS, suggesting that the new data may serve as a regional proxy for recent temporal trends in West Antarctic accumulation rates. The observed negative trend in accumulation is likely the result of a shift in low-pressure systems over the Amundsen Sea region, dominated by changes in the austral fall season. Regional-scale climate models and reanalysis data do not capture the negative trend in accumulation rate observed in these firn cores. Nevertheless the models and reanalyses agree well in both accumulation-rate means and interannual variability, with no single model or dataset standing out as significantly more skilled at capturing the observed magnitude of and trend in accumulation rates in this region of the WAIS.},

  abstract = {The East Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest, highest, coldest, driest, and windiest ice sheet on Earth. Understanding of the surface mass balance (SMB) of Antarctica is necessary to determine the present state of the ice sheet, to make predictions of its potential contribution to sea level rise, and to determine its past history for paleoclimatic reconstructions. However, SMB values are poorly known because of logistic constraints in extreme polar environments, and they represent one of the biggest challenges of Antarctic science. Snow accumulation is the most important parameter for the SMB of ice sheets. SMB varies on a number of scales, from small-scale features (sastrugi) to ice-sheet-scale SMB patterns determined mainly by temperature, elevation, distance from the coast, and wind-driven processes. In situ measurements of SMB are performed at single points by stakes, ultrasonic sounders, snow pits, and firn and ice cores and laterally by continuous measurements using ground-penetrating radar. SMB for large regions can only be achieved practically by using remote sensing and/or numerical climate modeling. However, these techniques rely on ground truthing to improve the resolution and accuracy. The separation of spatial and temporal variations of SMB in transient regimes is necessary for accurate interpretation of ice core records. In this review we provide an overview of the various measurement techniques, related difficulties, and limitations of data interpretation; describe spatial characteristics of East Antarctic SMB and issues related to the spatial and temporal representativity of measurements; and provide recommendations on how to perform in situ measurements.},

  abstract = {Predictions concerning Antarctica's contribution to sea level change have been hampered by poor knowledge of surface mass balance. Snow accumulation is the most direct climate indicator and has important implications for paleoclimatic reconstruction from ice cores. Snow accumulation measurements (stake, core, snow radar) taken along a 500-km transect crossing Talos Dome (East Antarctica) have been used to assess accumulation signals and the representativeness of ice core records. Stake readings show that accumulation hiatuses can occur at sites with accumulation rates below 120 kg m-2 yr-1. Differences between cores and stakes can lead to statistical misidentification of annual layers determined from seasonal signals at sites with accumulation rates below 200 kg m-2 yr-1 because of nondetection of higher and lower values. Achieving {$\pm$}10\% accuracy in the reconstruction of snow accumulation from single cores requires high accumulation (750 kg m-2 yr-1). Low-accumulation sites are representative if cumulative rates computed over several years are used to reach the 750 kg m-2 yr-1 threshold. Temporal variability of accumulation over the last two centuries shows no significant increase in accumulation. Wind-driven processes are a fundamental component of surface mass balance. Spatial variations in accumulation are well correlated with surface slope changes along the wind direction and may exceed 200 kg m-2 yr-1 within 1 km. Wind-driven sublimation rates are less than 50 kg m-2 yr-1 in plateau areas and up to 260 kg m-2 yr-1 in slope areas and account for 20\textendash 75\% of precipitation, whereas depositional features are negligible in surface mass balance.},

  abstract = {The seasonal distribution of snow at the South Pole and its relationship to stratigraphy was investigated to pits dug beside a number of four-year-old accumulation stakes. Results show that conventional stratigraphic methods yield thoroughly reliable values of accumulation rates. Even hiatuses in accumulation can be identified from the intensity of sublimation of layers of depth hoar in the stratigraphic section. Such hiatuses are due almost invariably to the prolonged absence of accumulation rather than to widespread scouring of pre-existing layers of snow. The bulk of the year's accumulation is deposited as dunes during winter. The majority of dunes are subsequently transformed into linear sastrugi by wind with the result that the amplitude of surface relief observed at the end of winter frequently exceeds the average thickness of snow accumulated annually. Such gross relief does not persist to the end of summer, however. Instead the dunes and sastrugi arc gradually worn down by a process of sublimation-deflation. It is this leveling of the surface relief in summer and the resultant redistribution of snow more uniformly over the surface that are believed to be the significant factors in the formation of the systematic stratigraphy observed in pits at the South Pole.          ,              R\'esum\'e             La distribution saisonni\`ere de la neige au P\^ole Sud et sa relation avec la stratigraphie ont \'et\'e \'etudi\'ees dans des puits creus\'es a c\^ot\'e d'un certain nombre de balises d'accumulation ag\'ees de quatre ans.

Cependant de tels reliefs ne subsistent pas jusqu'\`a la fin de l'\'et\'e. Ainsi, les dunes et sastrugis sont graduellement us\'es par un processus de sublimation-d\'eflation. C'est ce nivellement du relief superficiel et la redistribution r\'esultante de la neige plus uniform\'ement sur la surface qui semblent \^etre les facteurs d\'eterminants de la formation de la stratigraphie syst\'ematique observ\'ee dans les puits du P\^ole Sud.          ,              Zusammenfassung             Die jahreszeitliche Verteilung des Schnees am S\"udpol und ihre Beziehung zur Stratigraphie wurde in Sch\"achten untersucht, die neben einer Anzahl von 4 Jahre alten Pegelstangen gegraben wurden.

Data confirming those changes are derived from remote sensing, regional climate models (RCMs), firn cores and automatic weather stations (AWSs) on the ice sheet. Data sources comprise different extents in area coverage. While remote sensing and RCMs cover at least regional scales with an extent ranging from 1\&ndash;10\&thinsp;km, AWS data and firn cores are point observations. To link such regional scales with point measurements, we investigate the spatial variability of snow accumulation within areas of approximately 1\&ndash;4\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{2} and its temporal changes. At three different sites of the southwestern GrIS (Swiss Camp, KAN-U, Dye-2), we performed extensive ground-penetrating radar (GPR) transects and numerous snow pits. In dry snow conditions, radar-measured two-way travel time can be converted to snow depth and snow accumulation if the density is known. Density variations per site for snow pits within distances of up to 1\&thinsp;km are found to be consistently within {$\pm$}5\&thinsp;\%. GPR transects were further filtered to remove small scale surface-related noise. The combined uncertainty of density variations and spatial filtering of radar transects is at 7\&ndash;8\&thinsp;\% per regional scale. To link point observations with regional scales, we analyze for spatial representativeness of snow pits. It occurs that with a probability of \emph{p} = 0.8 (KAN-U) to \emph{p} {$>$} 0.95 (Swiss Camp and Dye-2), randomly selected snow pits are representative in snow accumulation for entire regions with an offset of {$\pm$}10\&thinsp;\% from arithmetic means. However, to achieve such high representativeness of snow pits, it is required to average snow depth for an area of at least 20\&thinsp;m x 20\&thinsp;m. Interannual accumulation pattern at Dye-2 are very persistent for two subsequent accumulation seasons with similarity probabilities of \emph{p} {$>$} 0.95, if again an error of {$\pm$}10\&thinsp;\% is included. Using target reflectors placed at respective end-of-summer-melt horizons, we additionally analyzed for occurrences of lateral redistribution within one melt season. In this study, we show that at Dye-2 lateral flow of meltwater cannot be evidenced in the current climate. Such studies of spatial representativeness and temporal changes in accumulation are inevitable to assess reliability of the linkage between point measurements and regional scale data and predictions, which are used for validation and calibration of remote sensing data and RCM outputs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, from approximately 200 km south of the NEEM drill site, the accumulation rate shows temporal variations based on our centennial averages. We attribute this variation to shifts in the location of the high\textendash low accumulation boundary that usually is aligned with the ice divide, but appears to have moved across the divide in the past.},

We apply this method to ground-based and airborne radar in a 175-km transect of the West Antarctic interior and compare the results to traditional manual methods and independent estimates from firn cores. The method demonstrates an automated estimation of SMB across a range of accumulation rates (100\textendash 450-mm water equivalent per year) and layer gradients up to 2 m/km. Based on likelihood-weighted F-scores, automated layer picks have a success rate between 64\% and 84.6\% compared with manually picked layers for three validation sites dispersed across the region. Comparisons between the automated SMB estimates and independent firn cores show a bias of 24 {$\pm$} 70-mm water equivalent per year (12\% {$\pm$} 35\% water equivalent of the in situ mean accumulation rate) although individual core site biases differ. This new approach permits the fully automated extraction of annual SMB rates and should be broadly and readily applicable to previously collected and ongoing radar data sets across polar regions.},

  abstract = {Contemporary climate warming over the Arctic is accelerating mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet through increasing surface melt, emphasizing the need to closely monitor its surface mass balance in order to improve sea-level rise predictions. Snow accumulation is the largest component of the ice sheet's surface mass balance, but in situ observations thereof are inherently sparse and models are difficult to evaluate at large scales. Here, we quantify recent Greenland accumulation rates using ultra-wideband (2-6.5 GHz) airborne snow radar data collected as part of NASA's Operation IceBridge between 2009 and 2012. We use a semiautomated method to trace the observed radiostratigraphy and then derive annual net accumulation rates for 2009-2012. The uncertainty in these radar-derived accumulation rates is on average 14 \%. A comparison of the radar-derived accumulation rates and contemporaneous ice cores shows that snow radar captures both the annual and long-term mean accumulation rate accurately. A comparison with outputs from a regional climate model (MAR) shows that this model matches radar-derived accumulation rates in the ice sheet interior but produces higher values over southeastern Greenland. Our results demonstrate that snow radar can efficiently and accurately map patterns of snow accumulation across an ice sheet and that it is valuable for evaluating the accuracy of surface mass balance models.},

Progressive improvements in radar hardware and data processing methodologies have led to improved data quality for subsequent retrieval of snow depth. Existing retrieval algorithms differ in the way the air\textendash snow (a\textendash s) and snow\textendash ice (s\textendash i) interfaces are detected and localized in the radar returns and in how the system limitations are addressed (e.g., noise, resolution). In 2014, the Snow Thickness On Sea Ice Working Group (STOSIWG) was formed and tasked with investigating how radar data quality affects snow depth retrievals and how retrievals from the various algorithms differ. The goal is to understand the limitations of the estimates and to produce a well-documented, long-term record that can be used for understanding broader changes in the Arctic climate system. Here, we assess five retrieval algorithms by comparisons with field measurements from two ground-based campaigns, including the BRomine, Ozone, and Mercury EXperiment (BROMEX) at Barrow, Alaska; a field program by Environment and Climate Change Canada at Eureka, Nunavut; and available climatology and snowfall from ERA-Interim reanalysis. The aim is to examine available algorithms and to use the assessment results to inform the development of future approaches. We present results from these assessments and highlight key considerations for the production of a long-term, calibrated geophysical record of springtime snow thickness over Arctic sea ice.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Surface mass balance (SMB) provides mass input to the surface of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and therefore comprises an important control on ice sheet mass balance and resulting contribution to global sea level change. As ice sheet SMB varies highly across multiple scales of space (meters to hundreds of kilometers) and time (hourly to decadal), it is notoriously challenging to observe and represent in models. In addition, SMB consists of multiple components, all of which depend on complex interactions between the atmosphere and the snow/ice surface, large-scale atmospheric circulation and ocean conditions, and ice sheet topography. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge and recent advances in ice sheet SMB observations and models, highlight current shortcomings, and propose future directions. Novel observational methods allow mapping SMB across larger areas, longer time periods, and/or at very high (subdaily) temporal frequency. As a recent observational breakthrough, cosmic ray counters provide direct estimates of SMB, circumventing the need for accurate snow density observations upon which many other techniques rely. Regional atmospheric climate models have drastically improved their simulation of ice sheet SMB in the last decade, thanks to the inclusion or improved representation of essential processes (e.g., clouds, blowing snow, and snow albedo), and by enhancing horizontal resolution (5\textendash 30 km). Future modeling efforts are required in improving Earth system models to match regional atmospheric climate model performance in simulating ice sheet SMB, and in reinforcing the efforts in developing statistical and dynamic downscaling to represent smaller-scale SMB processes.},

Our analysis found a wide range of capabilities, including imaging of post firn\textendash ice transition horizons and sounding of shallow glaciers and ice shelves. Imaging of horizons to depths exceeding 600 m was possible in the colder interior regions of the ice sheet, where scattering from the ice surface and inclusions was minimal. The radar's high sensitivity and large dynamic range point to loss tangent variations as the dominant mechanism for these englacial reflective horizons. The radar is capable of mapping interfaces with reflection coefficients as low as -80 dB near the firn\textendash ice transition and as low as -64 dB at depths of 600 m. We found that firn horizon reflectivity strongly mirrored density variance, a result of the near-unity interfacial transmission coefficients. Zones with differing compaction mechanisms were also apparent in the data. We were able to sound many ice shelves and areas of shallow ice. We estimated ice attenuation rates for a few locations, and our attenuation estimates for the Ross Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, appear to agree well with earlier reported results.},

An improved understanding of temporal and spatial variability of snow accumulation will reduce uncertainties in GrIS mass balance models and improve projections of Greenland's contribution to sea-level rise, currently estimated at 0.089 {$\pm$} 0.03 m by 2100. Here we analyze 25 NASA Operation IceBridge accumulation radar flights totaling \&gt; 17 700 km from 2013 to 2014 to determine snow accumulation in the GrIS dry snow and percolation zones over the past 100\textendash 300 years. IceBridge accumulation rates are calculated and used to validate accumulation rates from three regional climate models. Averaged over all 25 flights, the RMS difference between the models and IceBridge accumulation is between 0.023 {$\pm$} 0.019 and 0.043 {$\pm$} 0.029 m w.e. a\textsuperscript{-1}, although each model shows significantly larger differences from IceBridge accumulation on a regional basis. In the southeast region, for example, the Mod\`ele Atmosph\'erique R\'egional (MARv3.5.2) overestimates by an average of 20.89 {$\pm$} 6.75 \% across the drainage basin. Our results indicate that these regional differences between model and IceBridge accumulation are large enough to significantly alter GrIS surface mass balance estimates. Empirical orthogonal function analysis suggests that the first two principal components account for 33 and 19 \% of the variance, and correlate with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively. Regions that disagree strongest with climate models are those in which we have the fewest IceBridge data points, requiring additional in situ measurements to verify model uncertainties.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

While remotely sensed observations of ice velocity and thickness over the major outlet glaciers have improved our understanding of ice loss to the ocean, snow accumulation over the vast Antarctic interior remains largely unmeasured. Here, we show that an airborne radar system, combined with ice-core glaciochemical analysis, provide the means necessary to measure the accumulation rate at the catchment-scale along the Amundsen Sea coast of West Antarctica. We used along-track radar-derived accumulation to generate a 1985\textendash 2009 average accumulation grid that resolves moderate- to large-scale features ({$>$}25 km) over the Pine Island\textendash Thwaites glacier drainage system. Comparisons with estimates from atmospheric models and gridded climatologies generally show our results as having less accumulation in the lower-elevation coastal zone but greater accumulation in the interior. Ice discharge, measured over discrete time intervals between 1994 and 2012, combined with our catchment-wide accumulation rates provide an 18-year mass balance history for the sector. While Thwaites Glacier lost the most ice in the mid-1990s, Pine Island Glacier's losses increased substantially by 2006, overtaking Thwaites as the largest regional contributor to sea-level rise. The trend of increasing discharge for both glaciers, however, appears to have leveled off since 2008.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We tracked continuous internal reflection horizons between the firn cores using a 400 MHz ground-penetrating radar (GPR). GPR data combined with depth-age scales from the firn cores provide accumulation rates along a 70 km transect. We followed an elevation gradient from {$\sim$}2350 to {$\sim$}1830m to understand how progressive surface melt may affect the ability to chemically date the firn cores and trace the internal layers with GPR. From the firn cores, we find a 52\% ({$\sim$}0.43 m w.e. a-1) increase in average snow accumulation and greater interannual variability at the lower site than the upper site. The GPR profiling reveals that accumulation rates are influenced by topographic undulations on the surface, with up to 23\% variability over 7 km.

  abstract = {Sea ice is generally covered with snow, which can vary in thickness from a few centimeters to {$>$}1 m. Snow cover acts as a thermal insulator modulating the heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere, and it impacts sea-ice growth rates and overall thickness, a key indicator of climate change in polar regions. Snow depth is required to estimate sea-ice thickness using freeboard measurements made with satellite altimeters. The snow cover also acts as a mechanical load that depresses ice freeboard (snow and ice above sea level). Freeboard depression can result in flooding of the snow/ice interface and the formation of a thick slush layer, particularly in the Antarctic sea-ice cover. The Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) has developed an ultra-wideband, microwave radar capable of operation on long-endurance aircraft to characterize the thickness of snow over sea ice. The low-power, 100 mW signal is swept from 2 to 8 GHz allowing the air/snow and snow/ ice interfaces to be mapped with 5 cm range resolution in snow; this is an improvement over the original system that worked from 2 to 6.5 GHz. From 2009 to 2012, CReSIS successfully operated the radar on the NASA P-3B and DC-8 aircraft to collect data on snow-covered sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic for NASA Operation IceBridge. The radar was found capable of snow depth retrievals ranging from 10 cm to {$>$}1 m. We also demonstrated that this radar can be used to map near-surface internal layers in polar firn with fine range resolution.

In general, highs in snow accumulation rate correspond with topographic lows, resulting in a negative correlation coefficient of {$<$}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M5" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{$><$}mrow{$><$}msup{$><$}mi{$>$}r{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn mathvariant="normal"{$>$}2{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msup{$><$}mo{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mo{$>$}-{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn mathvariant="normal"{$>$}0.32{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}{$<$}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="54pt" height="14pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="5ed32971497199b4f64d23960fca493d"{$><$}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tc-14-3287-2020-ie00001.svg" width="54pt" height="14pt" src="tc-14-3287-2020-ie00001.png"/{$><$}/svg:svg{$>$} between accumulation rate and MSWD (mean slope in the mean wind direction). This relationship is strongest in areas where the dominant wind direction is parallel to the survey profile, which is expected as the geophysical surveys only capture a two-dimensional cross section of snow redistribution. Variability in snow accumulation appears to correlate with variability in MSWD. The correlation coefficient between the standard deviations of accumulation rate and MSWD is \emph{r}\textsuperscript{2}=0.48, indicating a stronger link between the standard deviations than the actual parameters. Our analysis shows that there is no simple relationship between surface slope, wind direction, and snow accumulation rates for the overall survey area. We find high variability in surface roughness derived from laser altimetry measurements on length scales smaller than 10\&thinsp;km, sometimes with very distinct and sharp transitions. Some areas also show significant temporal variability over the course of the 3 survey years. Ultimately, there is no statistically significant slope-independent relationship between surface roughness and accumulation rates within our survey area. The observed correspondence between the small-scale temporal and spatial variability in surface roughness and backscatter, as evidenced by Ku-band radar signal strength retrievals, will make it difficult to develop elevation bias corrections for radar altimeter retrieval algorithms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} We assess the recent contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea level change. We use the mass budget method, which quantifies ice sheet mass balance (MB) as the difference between surface mass balance (SMB) and solid ice discharge across the grounding line (\emph{D}). A comparison with independent gravity change observations from GRACE shows good agreement for the overlapping period 2002\textendash 2015, giving confidence in the partitioning of recent GrIS mass changes. The estimated 1995 value of \emph{D} and the 1958\textendash 1995 average value of SMB are similar at 411 and 418 Gt yr\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively, suggesting that ice flow in the mid-1990s was well adjusted to the average annual mass input, reminiscent of an ice sheet in approximate balance. Starting in the early to mid-1990s, SMB decreased while \emph{D} increased, leading to quasi-persistent negative MB. About 60 \% of the associated mass loss since 1991 is caused by changes in SMB and the remainder by \emph{D}. The decrease in SMB is fully driven by an increase in surface melt and subsequent meltwater runoff, which is slightly compensated by a small ( \&lt; 3 \%) increase in snowfall. The excess runoff originates from low-lying ( \&lt; 2000 m a.s.l.) parts of the ice sheet; higher up, increased refreezing prevents runoff of meltwater from occurring, at the expense of increased firn temperatures and depleted pore space. With a 1991\textendash 2015 average annual mass loss of {$\sim$} 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.23 mm sea level equivalent (SLE) and a peak contribution of 1.2 mm SLE in 2012, the GrIS has recently become a major source of global mean sea level rise.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Snow density estimates below the surface, used with airplane-acquired ice-penetrating radar measurements, give a site-specific history of snow water accumulation. Because it is infeasible to drill snow cores across all of Antarctica to measure snow density and because it is critical to understand how climatic changes are affecting the world's largest freshwater reservoir, we develop methods that enable snow density estimation with uncertainty in regions where snow cores have not been drilled. In inland West Antarctica, snow density increases monotonically as a function of depth, except for possible microscale variability or measurement error, and it cannot exceed the density of ice. We present a novel class of integrated spatial process models that allow interpolation of monotone snow density curves. For computational feasibility we construct the space-depth process through kernel convolutions of log-Gaussian spatial processes. We discuss model comparison, model fitting and prediction. Using this model, we extend estimates of snow density beyond the depth of the original core and estimate snow density curves where snow cores have not been drilled. Along flight lines with ice-penetrating radar, we use interpolated snow density curves to estimate recent water accumulation and find predominantly decreasing water accumulation over recent decades.},

Dr. Bhattacharya,

Please find attached our manuscript "Repeatability of Polar Accumulation Time Series from Interannual Repeat Radar Echograms", which we would like to submit for publication as an original research article in the journal *Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters*.
Our main result is that polar accumulation time series constructed using airborne radar imaging are generally reproducible over multi-year time periods and two different methods (a traditional manual method and an automated one).
Specific regions, however, demonstrate significant changes over multi-year time periods, warranting caution with assumptions of repeatability for all ice sheet regions.
This work has not been submitted elsewhere.

We believe this manuscript fits the aims of the journal as the findings are pertinent to the processing and interpretation of multi-year cyrospheric records using active microwave imaging.
Specifically, the research impacts current and future results of ice sheet annual accumulation time series based on data from the multi-year campaigns of NASA's Operation IceBridge mission.
With this data set now including nearly a decade of surveys, an investigation and improved understanding of how repeatable and comparable results derived from differing collection times are both scientifically relevant and timely.

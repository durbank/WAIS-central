The {SAM} is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere ({SH}) so such a change implies a major shift in the broadscale climate of this hemisphere. However, the majority of these studies have used {NCEP}–{NCAR} reanalysis ({NNR}) data, which are known to have spurious negative trends in {SH} high-latitude pressure. Thus, given that the {SAM} describes the relative atmospheric anomalies at mid- and high southern latitudes, these errors in the {NNR} data have the potential to invalidate the published findings on changes in the {SAM}. Therefore, it is important that a “true” benchmark of trends in the {SAM} is available against which future climate scenarios as revealed through climate models can be examined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper this issue is addressed by employing an empirical definition of the {SAM} so that station data can be utilized to evaluate true temporal changes: six stations are used to calculate a proxy zonal mean sea level pressure ({MSLP}) at both 40° and 65°S during 1958–2000. The observed increase in the difference in zonal {MSLP} between 40° (increasing) and 65°S (decreasing) is shown to be statistically significant, with the trend being most pronounced since the mid-1970s. However, it is demonstrated that calculated trends in the {MSLP} difference between 40° and 65°S and the {SAM} itself are exaggerated by a factor of 3 and 2, respectively, in the {NNR}. The {SH} high-latitude errors in the early part of this reanalysis are greatest in winter as are subsequent improvements. As a result, the {NNR} shows the greatest seasonal trend in the {SAM} to be in the austral winter, in marked contrast to observational data, which reveal the largest real increase to be in summer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Equivalent data from two {ECMWF} reanalyses, including part of the new {ERA}-40 reanalysis, are also examined. It is demonstrated that {ERA}-40 provides an improved representation of {SH} high-latitude atmospheric circulation variability that can be used with high confidence at least as far back as 1973—and is therefore ideal for examining the recent trend in the {SAM}—and with more confidence than the {NNR} right back to 1958.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Surface mass balance ({SMB}) is the net input of mass on a glacier's upper surface, composed of snow deposition, melt and erosion processes, and is a major contributor to the overall mass balance. Pine Island Glacier ({PIG}) in West Antarctica has been dynamically imbalanced since the early 1990s, indicating that discharge of solid ice into the oceans exceeds snow deposition. However, observations of the {SMB} pattern on the fast flowing regions are scarce, and are potentially affected by the firn's strain history. Here, we present new observations from radar-derived stratigraphy and a relatively dense network of firn cores, collected along a {\textasciitilde}900 km traverse of {PIG}. Between 1986 and 2014, the {SMB} along the traverse was 0.505 m w.e. a−1 on average with a gradient of higher snow deposition in the South-West compared with the North-East of the catchment. We show that along {\textasciitilde}80\% of the traverse the strain history amounts to a misestimation of {SMB} below the nominal uncertainty, but can exceed it by a factor 5 in places, making it a significant correction to the {SMB} estimate locally. We find that the strain correction changes the basin-wide {SMB} by {\textasciitilde}0.7 Gt a−1 and thus forms a negligible (1\%) correction to the glacier's total {SMB}.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Observed changes in the surface elevation of the Greenland Ice Sheet are caused by ice dynamics, basal elevation change, basal melt, surface mass balance ({SMB}) variability, and by compaction of the overlying firn. The last two contributions are quantified here using a firn model that includes compaction, meltwater percolation, and refreezing. The model is forced with surface mass fluxes and temperature from a regional climate model for the period 1960–2014. The model results agree with observations of surface density, density profiles from 62 firn cores, and altimetric observations from regions where ice-dynamical surface height changes are likely small. In areas with strong surface melt, the firn model overestimates density. We find that the firn layer in the high interior is generally thickening slowly (1–5 cm yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$). In the percolation and ablation areas, firn and {SMB} processes account for a surface elevation lowering of up to 20–50 cm yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$. Most of this firn-induced marginal thinning is caused by an increase in melt since the mid-1990s and partly compensated by an increase in the accumulation of fresh snow around most of the ice sheet. The total firn and ice volume change between 1980 and 2014 is estimated at −3295 ± 1030 km$^{\textrm{3}}$ due to firn and {SMB} changes, corresponding to an ice-sheet average thinning of 1.96 ± 0.61 m. Most of this volume decrease occurred after 1995. The computed changes in surface elevation can be used to partition altimetrically observed volume change into surface mass balance and ice-dynamically related mass changes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

δ18O were investigated in the first comprehensive study
of a set of 76 firn cores retrieved by various expeditions during the
past 3 decades in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. The large number
of cores was used to calculate stacked records of {SMB} and
δ18O, which considerably increased the signal-to-noise
ratio compared to earlier studies and facilitated the detection of
climatic signals. Considerable differences between cores from the
interior plateau and the coastal cores were found. The
δ18O of both the plateau and the ice shelf cores
exhibit a slight positive trend over the second half of the 20th
century. In the corresponding period, the {SMB} has a negative trend in
the ice shelf cores, but increases on the plateau. Comparison with
meteorological data from Neumayer Station revealed that for the ice
shelf regions, atmospheric dynamic effects are more important than
thermodynamics while on the plateau; the temporal variations of {SMB} and
δ18O occur mostly in parallel, and thus can be
explained by thermodynamic effects. The Southern Annular Mode ({SAM}) has
exhibited a positive trend since the mid-1960s, which is assumed to lead
to a cooling of East Antarctica. This is not confirmed by the firn core
data in our data set. Changes in the atmospheric circulation that result
in a changed seasonal distribution of precipitation/accumulation could
partly explain the observed features in the ice shelf cores.},

While the majority of the ice sheet has remained stable, 24\% of West Antarctica is now in a state of dynamical imbalance. Thinning of the Pine Island and Thwaites glacier basins reaches 122 m in places, and their rates of ice loss are now five times greater than at the start of our survey.

An examination of the surface air temperature–{SMB} relationship in model simulations demonstrates a strong link between the two. Reconstructions based on ice cores display a weaker relationship, indicating a model–data discrepancy that may be due to model biases or to the non-climatic noise present in the records. We find that, on the regional scale, the modeled relationship between surface air temperature and {SMB} is often stronger than between temperature and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. This suggests that {SMB} data can be used to reconstruct past surface air temperature. Using this finding, we assimilate isotope-enabled {SMB} and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater} model output with ice core observations to generate a new surface air temperature reconstruction. Although an independent evaluation of the skill is difficult because of the short observational time series, this new reconstruction outperforms the previous reconstructions for the continental-mean temperature that were based on {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater} alone. The improvement is most significant for the East Antarctic region, where the uncertainties are particularly large. Finally, using the same data assimilation method as for the surface air temperature reconstruction, we provide a spatial {SMB} reconstruction for the {AIS} over the last 2 centuries, showing large variability in {SMB} trends at a regional scale, with an increase (0.82\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) in West Antarctica over 1957–2000 and a decrease in East Antarctica during the same period ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−0.13{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}).

By testing a range of noise models, we find that a Generalized Gauss Markov ({GGM}) model better approximates the noise around a linear trend. The general preference for {GGM} noise applies over spatial scales from the total ice sheet down to individual drainage basins. Over the longest timescales considered, trend uncertainties are 1.3–2.3 times larger using a {GGM} model compared to using an {AR}1 model at the ice sheet scale.

	abstract = {The surface mass balance ({SMB}) of the Larsen C ice shelf ({LCIS}), Antarctica, is poorly constrained due to a dearth of in situ observations. Combining several geophysical techniques, we reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of {SMB} over the {LCIS}. Continuous time series of snow height (2.5–6 years) at five locations allow for multi-year estimates of seasonal and annual {SMB} over the {LCIS}. There is high interannual variability in {SMB} as well as spatial variability: in the north, {SMB} is 0.40 ± 0.06 to 0.41 ± 0.04 m w.e. year−1, while farther south, {SMB} is up to 0.50 ± 0.05 m w.e. year−1. This difference between north and south is corroborated by winter snow accumulation derived from an airborne radar survey from 2009, which showed an average snow thickness of 0.34 m w.e. north of 66° S, and 0.40 m w.e. south of 68° S. Analysis of ground-penetrating radar from several field campaigns allows for a longer-term perspective of spatial variations in {SMB}: a particularly strong and coherent reflection horizon below 25–44 m of water-equivalent ice and firn is observed in radargrams collected across the shelf. We propose that this horizon was formed synchronously across the ice shelf. Combining snow height observations, ground and airborne radar, and {SMB} output from a regional climate model yields a gridded estimate of {SMB} over the {LCIS}. It confirms that {SMB} increases from north to south, overprinted by a gradient of increasing {SMB} to the west, modulated in the west by föhn-induced sublimation. Previous observations show a strong decrease in firn air content toward the west, which we attribute to spatial patterns of melt, refreezing, and densification rather than {SMB}.},

To fill this gap, regional atmospheric climate modelling is useful, providing that such models are employed at sufficiently high horizontal resolution and coupled with a snow model. Here we present the results of a high-resolution (5.5 km) regional atmospheric climate model ({RACMO}2) simulation of coastal West Antarctica for the period 1979–2015. We evaluate the results with available in situ weather observations, remote-sensing estimates of surface melt, and {SMB} estimates derived from radar and firn cores. Moreover, results are compared with those from a lower-resolution version, to assess the added value of the resolution. The high-resolution model resolves small-scale climate variability invoked by topography, such as the relatively warm conditions over ice-shelf grounding zones, and local wind speed accelerations. Surface melt and {SMB} are well reproduced by {RACMO}2. This dataset will prove useful for picking ice core locations, converting elevation changes to mass changes, for driving ocean, ice-sheet and coupled models, and for attributing changes in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and shelves to changes in atmospheric forcing.},

	abstract = {Changes in accumulated snowfall over the Antarctic Ice Sheet have an immediate and time-delayed impact on global mean sea level. The immediate impact is due to the instantaneous change in freshwater storage over the ice sheet, whereas the time-delayed impact acts in opposition through enhanced ice-dynamic flux into the ocean1. Here, we reconstruct 200 years of Antarctic-wide snow accumulation by synthesizing a newly compiled database of ice core records2 using reanalysis-derived spatial coherence patterns. The results reveal that increased snow accumulation mitigated twentieth-century sea-level rise by {\textasciitilde}10 mm since 1901, with rates increasing from 1.1 mm decade−1 between 1901 and 2000 to 2.5 mm decade−1 after 1979. Reconstructed accumulation trends are highly variable in both sign and magnitude at the regional scale, and linked to the trend towards a positive Southern Annular Mode since 19573. Because the observed Southern Annular Mode trend is accompanied by a decrease in Antarctic Ice Sheet accumulation, changes in the strength and location of the circumpolar westerlies cannot explain the reconstructed increase, which may instead be related to stratospheric ozone depletion4. However, our results indicate that a warming atmosphere cannot be excluded as a dominant force in the underlying increase.},

Earth's ice sheets are melting and sea levels are rising, so it behooves us to understand better which climate processes are responsible for how much of the mass loss. Smith et al. estimated grounded and floating ice mass change for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets from 2003 to 2019 using satellite laser altimetry data from {NASA}'s {ICESat} and {ICESat}-2 satellites. They show how changing ice flow, melting, and precipitation affect different regions of ice and estimate that grounded-ice loss averaged close to 320 gigatons per year over that period and contributed 14 millimeters to sea level rise.
Science, this issue p. 1239
Quantifying changes in Earth’s ice sheets and identifying the climate drivers are central to improving sea level projections. We provide unified estimates of grounded and floating ice mass change from 2003 to 2019 using {NASA}’s Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite ({ICESat}) and {ICESat}-2 satellite laser altimetry. Our data reveal patterns likely linked to competing climate processes: Ice loss from coastal Greenland (increased surface melt), Antarctic ice shelves (increased ocean melting), and Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers (dynamic response to ocean melting) was partially compensated by mass gains over ice sheet interiors (increased snow accumulation). Losses outpaced gains, with grounded-ice loss from Greenland (200 billion tonnes per year) and Antarctica (118 billion tonnes per year) contributing 14 millimeters to sea level. Mass lost from West Antarctica’s ice shelves accounted for more than 30\% of that region’s total.
Satellite laser altimetry shows the extent of ice sheet mass loss since 2003.

	abstract = {Since the 1950s, research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula have recorded some of the largest increases in near-surface air temperature in the Southern Hemisphere1. This warming has contributed to the regional retreat of glaciers2, disintegration of floating ice shelves3 and a ‘greening’ through the expansion in range of various flora4. Several interlinked processes have been suggested as contributing to the warming, including stratospheric ozone depletion5, local sea-ice loss6, an increase in westerly winds5,7, and changes in the strength and location of low–high-latitude atmospheric teleconnections8,9. Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer. Temperatures have decreased as a consequence of a greater frequency of cold, east-to-southeasterly winds, resulting from more cyclonic conditions in the northern Weddell Sea associated with a strengthening mid-latitude jet. These circulation changes have also increased the advection of sea ice towards the east coast of the peninsula, amplifying their effects. Our findings cover only 1\% of the Antarctic continent and emphasize that decadal temperature changes in this region are not primarily associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation.},

Here, the authors summarize the current understanding of the {ASL}, using reanalysis datasets to analyze recent variability and trends, as well as ice-core chemistry and climate model projections, to examine past and future changes in the {ASL}, respectively. The {ASL} has deepened in recent decades, affecting the climate through its influence on the regional meridional wind field, which controls the advection of moisture and heat into the continent. Deepening of the {ASL} in spring is consistent with observed West Antarctic warming and greater sea ice extent in the Ross Sea. Climate model simulations for recent decades indicate that this deepening is mediated by tropical variability while climate model projections through the twenty-first century suggest that the {ASL} will deepen in some seasons in response to greenhouse gas concentration increases.},

The zonal location of the {ASL} is linked to the phase of the mid-tropospheric planetary waves and the low moves west from close to 110°W in January to near 150°W in June as planetary waves 1 to 3 amplify and their phases shift westwards.

Over 1979–2008 the low has deepened in January by 1.7 {hPa} dec−1 as the {SAM} has become more positive. It has also deepened in spring and autumn as the semi-annual oscillation has increase in amplitude over the last 30 years. An increase in central pressure and eastward shift in March has occurred as a result of a cooling of tropical Pacific {SSTs} that altered the strength of the polar front jet.

A total of 79 ice core snow accumulation records were gathered and assigned to seven geographical regions, separating the high-accumulation coastal zones below 2000 m of elevation from the dry central Antarctic Plateau. The regional composites of annual snow accumulation were evaluated against modelled surface mass balance ({SMB}) from {RACMO}2.3p2 and precipitation from {ERA}-Interim reanalysis. With the exception of the Weddell Sea coast, the low-elevation composites capture the regional precipitation and {SMB} variability as defined by the models. The central Antarctic sites lack coherency and either do not represent regional precipitation or indicate the model inability to capture relevant precipitation processes in the cold, dry central plateau. Our results show that {SMB} for the total Antarctic Ice Sheet (including ice shelves) has increased at a rate of 7 ± 0.13 Gt decade−1 since 1800 {AD}, representing a net reduction in sea level of ∼ 0.02 mm decade−1 since 1800 and ∼ 0.04 mm decade−1 since 1900 {AD}. The largest contribution is from the Antarctic Peninsula (∼ 75 \%) where the annual average {SMB} during the most recent decade (2001–2010) is 123 ± 44 Gt yr−1 higher than the annual average during the first decade of the 19th century. Only four ice core records cover the full 1000 years, and they suggest a decrease in snow accumulation during this period. However, our study emphasizes the importance of low-elevation coastal zones, which have been under-represented in previous investigations of temporal snow accumulation.},

	abstract = {The Pacific sector of Antarctica, including both the Antarctic Peninsula and continental West Antarctica, has experienced substantial warming in the past 30 years. An increase in the circumpolar westerlies, owing in part to the decline in stratospheric ozone concentrations since the late 1970s, may account for warming trends in the peninsula region in austral summer and autumn. The more widespread warming in continental West Antarctica (Ellsworth Land and Marie Byrd Land) occurs primarily in austral winter and spring, and remains unexplained. Here we use observations of Antarctic surface temperature and global sea surface temperature, and atmospheric circulation data to show that recent warming in continental West Antarctica is linked to sea surface temperature changes in the tropical Pacific. Over the past 30 years, anomalous sea surface temperatures in the central tropical Pacific have generated an atmospheric Rossby wave response that influences atmospheric circulation over the Amundsen Sea, causing increased advection of warm air to the Antarctic continent. General circulation model experiments show that the central tropical Pacific is a critical region for producing the observed high latitude response. We conclude that, by affecting the atmospheric circulation at high southern latitudes, increasing tropical sea surface temperatures may account for West Antarctic warming through most of the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {Changes in atmospheric circulation over the past five decades have enhanced the wind-driven inflow of warm ocean water onto the Antarctic continental shelf, where it melts ice shelves from below. Atmospheric circulation changes have also caused rapid warming over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and contributed to declining sea-ice cover in the adjacent Amundsen–Bellingshausen seas. It is unknown whether these changes are part of a longer-term trend. Here, we use water-isotope (δ18O) data from an array of ice-core records to place recent West Antarctic climate changes in the context of the past two millennia. We find that the δ18O of West Antarctic precipitation has increased significantly in the past 50 years, in parallel with the trend in temperature, and was probably more elevated during the 1990s than at any other time during the past 200 years. However, δ18O anomalies comparable to those of recent decades occur about 1\% of the time over the past 2,000 years. General circulation model simulations suggest that recent trends in δ18O and climate in West Antarctica cannot be distinguished from decadal variability that originates in the tropics. We conclude that the uncertain trajectory of tropical climate variability represents a significant source of uncertainty in projections of West Antarctic climate and ice-sheet change.},

	abstract = {The East Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest, highest, coldest, driest, and windiest ice sheet on Earth. Understanding of the surface mass balance ({SMB}) of Antarctica is necessary to determine the present state of the ice sheet, to make predictions of its potential contribution to sea level rise, and to determine its past history for paleoclimatic reconstructions. However, {SMB} values are poorly known because of logistic constraints in extreme polar environments, and they represent one of the biggest challenges of Antarctic science. Snow accumulation is the most important parameter for the {SMB} of ice sheets. {SMB} varies on a number of scales, from small-scale features (sastrugi) to ice-sheet-scale {SMB} patterns determined mainly by temperature, elevation, distance from the coast, and wind-driven processes. In situ measurements of {SMB} are performed at single points by stakes, ultrasonic sounders, snow pits, and firn and ice cores and laterally by continuous measurements using ground-penetrating radar. {SMB} for large regions can only be achieved practically by using remote sensing and/or numerical climate modeling. However, these techniques rely on ground truthing to improve the resolution and accuracy. The separation of spatial and temporal variations of {SMB} in transient regimes is necessary for accurate interpretation of ice core records. In this review we provide an overview of the various measurement techniques, related difficulties, and limitations of data interpretation; describe spatial characteristics of East Antarctic {SMB} and issues related to the spatial and temporal representativity of measurements; and provide recommendations on how to perform in situ measurements.},

Second, the time-dependent model is run for 3 Antarctic locations with different climate conditions. Surface height changes are caused by a combination of accumulation, melting and ﬁrn densiﬁcation processes. On all 3 locations, an upward trend of the surface during autumn, winter and spring is present, while during summer there is a more rapid lowering of the surface.

The ice cores were dated based on annual layer counting of multiple glaciochemical measurements resulting in bottom depth ages for {WDC}05A, {WDC}05Q, and {ITASE} 00-1 of 1775, 1521, and 1653 A.D., with mean annual accumulation rates of 0.200, 0.204, and 0.221 mweq a−1, respectively. Small-scale spatial variability ({SSV}) was determined using an analysis of variance of accumulation in the ice core array, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in individual accumulation records. Results indicate that the spatial variability was 0.030 mweq a−1, or approximately 15\% of the average annual accumulation. An accumulation record representative of the {WAIS} Divide local area over recent centuries was developed using a principal component analysis to identify the coherent accumulation signal. The {WAIS} Divide local record exhibited 14\% interannual variability (1 standard deviation of the mean) with the {SSV} reduced to 0.017 mweq a−1. Correlations of the {WAIS} Divide local accumulation record with atmospheric indices (e.g., Antarctic Oscillation) exhibited periods when the records oscillate in and out of phase. Thus, reconstructing local and global atmospheric indices from {WAIS} Divide accumulation records over recent centuries may prove problematic.},

West Antarctica has probably warmed since the 1950s, but there is disagreement regarding the magnitude, seasonality and spatial extent of this warming. This is primarily because long-term near-surface temperature observations are restricted to Byrd Station in central West Antarctica, a data set with substantial gaps. Here, we present a complete temperature record for Byrd Station, in which observations have been corrected, and gaps have been filled using global reanalysis data and spatial interpolation. The record reveals a linear increase in annual temperature between 1958 and 2010 by 2.4±1.2 °C, establishing central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions globally. We confirm previous reports of West Antarctic warming, in annual average and in austral spring and winter, but find substantially larger temperature increases. In contrast to previous studies, we report statistically significant warming during austral summer, particularly in December–January, the peak of the melting season. A continued rise in summer temperatures could lead to more frequent and extensive episodes of surface melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. These results argue for a robust long-term meteorological observation network in the region.},

	abstract = {Observations of snow accumulation rates from five new firn cores show a negative trend that is statistically significant over the past several decades across the central West Antarctic ice sheet ({WAIS}). A negative temporal trend in accumulation rates is unexpected in light of rising surface temperatures as well as model simulations predicting higher accumulation rates for the region. Both the magnitude of the mean accumulation rates and the range of interannual variability observed in the new records compare favorably to older records collected from a broad area of the {WAIS}, suggesting that the new data may serve as a regional proxy for recent temporal trends in West Antarctic accumulation rates. The observed negative trend in accumulation is likely the result of a shift in low-pressure systems over the Amundsen Sea region, dominated by changes in the austral fall season. Regional-scale climate models and reanalysis data do not capture the negative trend in accumulation rate observed in these firn cores. Nevertheless the models and reanalyses agree well in both accumulation-rate means and interannual variability, with no single model or dataset standing out as significantly more skilled at capturing the observed magnitude of and trend in accumulation rates in this region of the {WAIS}.},

Here, we analyse recent atmosphere, surface ocean and sea-ice observations in this region and assess their trends in the context of palaeoclimate records and climate model simulations. Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.},

	abstract = {In contrast to earlier studies, the authors describe the climatological deep low pressure system that exists over the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, referred to as the Amundsen–Bellingshausen Seas low ({ABSL}), in terms of its relative (rather than actual) central pressure by removing the background area-averaged mean sea level pressure ({MSLP}). Doing so removes much of the influence of large-scale variability across the {ABSL} sector region (e.g., due to the southern annular mode), allowing a clearer understanding of {ABSL} variability and its effect on the regional climate of West Antarctica. Using {ECMWF} Interim Re-Analysis ({ERA}-Interim) fields, the annual cycle of the relative central pressure of the {ABSL} for the period from 1979 to 2011 shows a minimum (maximum) during winter (summer), differing considerably from the earlier studies based on actual central pressure, which suggests a semiannual oscillation. The annual cycle of the longitudinal position of the {ABSL} is insensitive to the background pressure, and shows it shifting westward from ∼250° to ∼220°E between summer and winter, in agreement with earlier studies. The authors demonstrate that {ABSL} variability, and in particular its longitudinal position, play an important role in controlling the surface climate of West Antarctica and the surrounding ocean by quantifying its influence on key meteorological parameters. Examination of the {ABSL} annual cycle in 17 {CMIP}5 climate models run with historical forcing shows that the majority of them have definite biases, especially in terms of longitudinal position, and a correspondingly poor representation of West Antarctic climate.},

	abstract = {An objective cyclone tracking algorithm is applied to twentieth century reanalysis (20CR) 6-hourly mean sea level pressure fields for the period 1871–2010 to infer historical trends and variability in extra-tropical cyclone activity. The tracking algorithm is applied both to the ensemble-mean analyses and to each of the 56 ensemble members individually. The ensemble-mean analyses are found to be unsuitable for accurately determining cyclone statistics. However, pooled cyclone statistics obtained by averaging statistics from individual members generally agree well with statistics from the {NCEP}-{NCAR} reanalyses for 1951–2010, although 20CR shows somewhat weaker cyclone activity over land and stronger activity over oceans. Both reanalyses show similar cyclone trend patterns in the northern hemisphere ({NH}) over 1951–2010. Homogenized pooled cyclone statistics are analyzed for trends and variability. Conclusions account for identified inhomogeneities, which occurred before 1949 in the {NH} and between 1951 and 1985 in the southern hemisphere ({SH}). Cyclone activity is estimated to have increased slightly over the period 1871–2010 in the {NH}. More substantial increases are seen in the {SH}. Notable regional and seasonal variations in trends are evident, as is profound decadal or longer scale variability. For example, the {NH} increases occur mainly in the mid-latitude Pacific and high-latitude Atlantic regions. For the North Atlantic-European region and southeast Australia, the 20CR cyclone trends are in agreement with trends in geostrophic wind extremes derived from in-situ surface pressure observations. European trends are also consistent with trends in the mean duration of wet spells derived from rain gauge data in Europe.},

The {SAM} signature in the Pacific sector resembles a tropically forced Rossby wave train, the so-called Pacific–South American pattern, while the signature in the Indian Ocean sector is a zonally elongated meridional dipole. Thus, the {SAM} contains strong zonally asymmetric variability and tends to behave differently in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, with internal dynamics prevailing in the Indian Ocean sector and the forced response to tropical {SST} anomalies exerting a strong influence in the Pacific sector. The tropically forced component of the {SAM} in the Pacific sector is related to a geographically fixed active Rossby wave source to the east of Australia within the core of the subtropical jet. In addition to the well-documented positive trend in summer, the {SAM} also exhibits a negative wintertime trend since 1979, characterized by prominent geopotential height increases over the high latitudes. In both seasons, {SAM} trends are closely linked to long-term trends in tropical Pacific {SST} that are independent of the canonical eastern Pacific {ENSO} variability. Although the {SAM} is an intrinsic pattern of high-latitude variability, the {SAM} index reflects the superposition of both high-latitude and tropically forced variability.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact that the four principal large-scale patterns of Southern Hemisphere ({SH}) atmospheric circulation variability have on Antarctic surface air temperature ({SAT}): (1) the southern baroclinic annular mode ({BAM}), which is associated with variations in extratropical storm amplitude; (2) the Southern Annular Mode ({SAM}), associated with latitudinal shifts in the midlatitude jet; and (3) the two Paciﬁc-South American patterns ({PSA}1 and {PSA}2), which are characterized by wave trains originating in the tropical Paciﬁc that extend across the {SH} extratropics. A key aspect is the use of 35 years of daily observations and reanalysis data, which affords a sufﬁciently large sample size to assess the signatures of the circulation patterns in both the mean and variability of daily mean {SAT} anomalies. The {BAM} exerts the weakest inﬂuence on Antarctic {SAT}, albeit it is still important over select regions. Consistent with previous studies, the {SAM} is shown to inﬂuence {SAT} across most of the continent throughout the year. The {PSA}1 also affects {SAT} across almost all of Antarctica. Regionally, both {PSA} patterns can exert a greater impact on {SAT} than the {SAM} but also have a signiﬁcantly weaker inﬂuence during summer, reﬂecting the seasonality of the {SH} response to El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The {SAM} and {PSA} patterns have distinct signatures in daily {SAT} variance that are physically consistent with their signatures in extratropical dynamic variability. The broad-scale climate linkages identiﬁed here provide benchmarks for interpreting the Antarctic climate response to future changes in tropical sea surface temperatures, ozone recovery, and greenhouse gas increases.},

Here, we present data from a new, annually dated ice core record from the eastern Ross Sea, named the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution ({RICE}) ice core. Comparison of this record with climate reanalysis data for the 1979–2012 interval shows that {RICE} reliably captures temperature and snow precipitation variability in the region. Trends over the past 2700 years in {RICE} are shown to be distinct from those in West Antarctica and the western Ross Sea captured by other ice cores. For most of this interval, the eastern Ross Sea was warming (or showing isotopic enrichment for other reasons), with increased snow accumulation and perhaps decreased sea ice concentration. However, West Antarctica cooled and the western Ross Sea showed no signiﬁcant isotope temperature trend. This pattern here is referred to as the Ross Sea Dipole. Notably, during the Little Ice Age, West Antarctica and the western Ross Sea experienced colder than average temperatures, while the eastern Ross Sea underwent a period of warming or increased isotopic enrichment. From the 17th century onwards, this dipole relationship changed. All three regions show current warming, with snow accumulation declining in West Antarctica and the eastern Ross Sea but increasing in the western Ross Sea. We interpret this pattern as reﬂecting an increase in sea ice in the eastern Ross Sea with perhaps the establishment of a modern Roosevelt Island polynya as a local moisture source for {RICE}.},

The reconstruction reveals a significant negative trend (-1.9 ± 2.2 Gt yr-1 decade-1) in the {SMB} over the entire {WAIS} during the 19th century, but a statistically significant positive trend of 5.4 ± 2.9 Gt yr-1 decade-1 between 1900 and 2010, in contrast to insignificant {WAIS} {SMB} changes during the 20th century reported earlier. At regional scales, the Antarctic Peninsula ({AP}) and western {WAIS} show opposite {SMB} trends, with different signs in the 19th and 20th centuries. The annual resolution reconstruction allows us to examine the relationships between {SMB} and large-scale atmospheric oscillations. Although {SMB} over the {AP} and western {WAIS} correlates significantly with the Southern Annular Mode ({SAM}) due to the influence of the Amundsen Sea Low ({ASL}) and El Niño/Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) during 1800-2010, the significant correlations are temporally unstable, associated with the phase of {SAM}, {ENSO} and the Pacific decadal oscillation ({PDO}). In addition, the two climate modes seem to contribute little to variability in {SMB} over the whole {WAIS} on decadal-centennial time scales. This new reconstruction also serves to identify unreliable precipitation trends in {ERA}-Interim, and thus has potential for assessing the skill of other reanalyses or climate models to capture precipitation trends and variability.},

	abstract = {In this study, 3265 multiyear averaged in situ observations and 29 observational records at annual time scale are used to examine the performance of recent reanalysis and regional atmospheric climate model products [ {ERA}-Interim, {JRA}-55, {MERRA}, the Polar version of {MM}5 ({PMM}5), {RACMO}2.1, and {RACMO}2.3] for their spatial and interannual variability of Antarctic surface mass balance ({SMB}), respectively. Simulated precipitation seasonality is also evaluated using three in situ observations and model intercomparison. All products qualitatively capture the macroscale spatial variability of observed {SMB}, but it is not possible to rank their relative performance because of the sparse observations at coastal regions with an elevation range from 200 to 1000 m. In terms of the absolute amount of observed snow accumulation in interior Antarctica, {RACMO}2.3 fits best, while the other models either underestimate ({JRA}-55, {MERRA}, {ERA}-Interim, and {RACMO}2.1) or overestimate ({PMM}5) the accumulation. Despite underestimated precipitation by the three reanalyses and {RACMO}2.1, this feature is clearly improved in {JRA}-55. However, because of changes in the observing system, especially the dramatically increased satellite observations for data assimilation, {JRA}-55 presents a marked jump in snow accumulation around 1979 and a large increase after the late 1990s. Although precipitation seasonality over the whole ice sheet is common for all products, {ERA}-Interim provides an unrealistic estimate of precipitation seasonality on the East Antarctic plateau, with high precipitation strongly peaking in summer. {ERA}-Interim shows a significant correlation with interannual variability of observed snow accumulation measurements at 28 of 29 locations, whereas fewer than 20 site observations significantly correlate with simulations by the other models. This suggests that {ERA}-Interim exhibits the highest performance of interannual variability in the observed precipitation.},

	abstract = {Four firn cores were retrieved in 2007 at two ridges in the area of the Ekström Ice Shelf, Dronning Maud Land, coastal East Antarctica, in order to investigate the recent regional climate variability and the potential for future extraction of an intermediate-depth core. Stable water-isotope analysis, tritium content and electrical conductivity were used to date the cores. For the period 1981–2006 a strong and significant correlation between the stable-isotope composition of firn cores in the hinterland and mean monthly air temperatures at Neumayer station was (r = 0.54−0.71). No atmospheric warming or cooling trend is inferred from our stable-isotope data for the period 1962–2006. The stable-isotope record of the ice/firn cores could expand well beyond the meteorological record of the region. No significant temporal variation of accumulation rates was detected. However, decreasing accumulation rates were found from coast to hinterland, as well as from east (Halvfarryggen) to west (Søråsen). The deuterium excess (d) exhibits similar differences (higher d at Søråsen, lower d at Halvfarryggen), with a weak negative temporal trend on Halvfarryggen (0.04‰ a−1), probably implying increasing oceanic input. We conclude that Halvfarryggen acts as a natural barrier for moisture-carrying air masses circulating in the region from east to west.},

Accumulation is controlled spatially by the topography of the ice sheet, and temporally by changes in moisture transport and cyclonic activity. A comparison of mean accumulation since 1970 at each site to the long-term mean indicates an increase in accumulation for sites located in the western sector of the Pine Island–Thwaites drainage system. Accumulation is negatively associated with the Southern Oscillation Index ({SOI}) for sites near the ice divide, and periods of sustained negative {SOI} (1940–42, 1991–95) correspond to above-mean accumulation at most sites. Correlations of the accumulation-rate records with sea-level pressure ({SLP}) and the {SOI} suggest that accumulation near the ice divide and in the Ross drainage system may be associated with the mid-latitudes. The post-1970 increase in accumulation coupled with strong {SLP}–accumulation-rate correlations near the coast suggests recent intensification of cyclonic activity in the Pine Island– Thwaites drainage system.},

More importantly, the combination of disciplines represented by {ITASE} provides a unique, multidimensional (space and time) view of the ice sheet and its history. {ITASE} has now collected {\textgreater}20 000km of snow radar, recovered more than 240 firn/ice cores (total length 7000 m), remotely penetrated to {\textasciitilde}4000m into the ice sheet, and sampled the atmosphere to heights of {\textgreater}20 km.},

	abstract = {Sea ice is generally covered with snow, which can vary in thickness from a few centimeters to {\textgreater}1 m. Snow cover acts as a thermal insulator modulating the heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere, and it impacts sea-ice growth rates and overall thickness, a key indicator of climate change in polar regions. Snow depth is required to estimate sea-ice thickness using freeboard measurements made with satellite altimeters. The snow cover also acts as a mechanical load that depresses ice freeboard (snow and ice above sea level). Freeboard depression can result in flooding of the snow/ice interface and the formation of a thick slush layer, particularly in the Antarctic sea-ice cover. The Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets ({CReSIS}) has developed an ultra-wideband, microwave radar capable of operation on long-endurance aircraft to characterize the thickness of snow over sea ice. The low-power, 100 {mW} signal is swept from 2 to 8 {GHz} allowing the air/snow and snow/ ice interfaces to be mapped with 5 cm range resolution in snow; this is an improvement over the original system that worked from 2 to 6.5 {GHz}. From 2009 to 2012, {CReSIS} successfully operated the radar on the {NASA} P-3B and {DC}-8 aircraft to collect data on snow-covered sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic for {NASA} Operation {IceBridge}. The radar was found capable of snow depth retrievals ranging from 10 cm to {\textgreater}1 m. We also demonstrated that this radar can be used to map near-surface internal layers in polar firn with fine range resolution. Here we describe the instrument design, characteristics and performance of the radar.},

Thus, accurately defining uncertainties associated with these in situ measurements is critical. In this study, we apply statistical simulation methods to quantify the uncertainty in firn-core accumulation data due to the uncertainty in depth–age scales. The methods are applied to a suite of firn cores from central West Antarctica. The results show that uncertainty in depth–age scales can give rise to spurious trends in accumulation that are the same order of magnitude as accumulation trends reported in West Antarctica. The depth–age scale uncertainties also significantly increase the apparent interannual accumulation variability, so these uncertainties must first be accounted for before using firn-core data to assess such processes as small-spatial-scale variability. Better quantification of error in accumulation will improve our ability to meaningfully compare firn-core data across different regions of the ice sheet, and provide appropriate targets for calibration and/or validation of model output and remote-sensing data.},

The study area is located on Ritscherflya in western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, at an elevation range 1400–1560 m. Accumulation rates are derived from internal reflection horizons ({IRHs}), tracked with {GPR}, which are connected to a dated firn core. {GPR}-derived internal layer depths show small relief along a 22 km profile on an ice flowline. Average accumulation rates are about 190 kg m−2 a−1 (1980–2005) with spatial variability (1σ) of 5\% along the {GPR} profile. The interannual variability obtained from four dated firn cores is one order of magnitude higher, showing 1σ standard deviations around 30\%. Mean temporal variations of {GPRderived} accumulation rates are of the same magnitude or even higher than spatial variations. Temporal differences between 1980–90 and 1990–2005, obtained from two dated {IRHs} along the {GPR} profile, indicate temporally non-stationary processes, linked to spatial variations. Comparison with similarly obtained accumulation data from another coastal area in central Dronning Maud Land confirms this observation. Our results contribute to understanding spatio-temporal variations of the accumulation processes, necessary for the validation of satellite data (e.g. altimetry studies and gravity missions such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ({GRACE})).},

An understanding of this transport and the properties that control it is important for predicting air–snow transfer of chemical species and for interpreting ice cores. Remote-sensing images of East Antarctica show large areas of alternating light and dark bands. These low-amplitude, long-wavelength features have glazed downwind faces and rough upwind faces and are called megadunes. The first linked measurements of the permeability and the associated microstructure for a glazed area within a well-defined megadune area are reported in this paper. Permeability and density were measured, along with grain-scale properties derived from digital image processing of preserved thick sections, at this cold, low-accumulation glazed site. A clear layering pattern exists. In the top meter the firn density ranges from 0.24 to 0.50 g cm–3. Permeability measurements range from 50 x 10–10 to 200 x 10–10μ2, several times greater than corresponding profiles from warmer, higher-accumulation sites like Siple Dome, Antarctica. It is shown that buoyancy-driven natural convection may be important in post-depositional processes in very cold, low-accumulation sites like this.},

Here, we present a probabilistic, fully automated approach to estimate annual {SMB} and uncertainties from radar echograms using successive peak-finding and weighted neighborhood search algorithms with the Monte Carlo simulations based on annual-layer likelihood scores. We apply this method to ground-based and airborne radar in a 175-km transect of the West Antarctic interior and compare the results to traditional manual methods and independent estimates from firn cores. The method demonstrates an automated estimation of {SMB} across a range of accumulation rates (100–450-mm water equivalent per year) and layer gradients up to 2 m/km. Based on likelihood-weighted F-scores, automated layer picks have a success rate between 64\% and 84.6\% compared with manually picked layers for three validation sites dispersed across the region. Comparisons between the automated {SMB} estimates and independent firn cores show a bias of 24 ± 70-mm water equivalent per year (12\% ± 35\% water equivalent of the in situ mean accumulation rate) although individual core site biases differ. This new approach permits the fully automated extraction of annual {SMB} rates and should be broadly and readily applicable to previously collected and ongoing radar data sets across polar regions.},

	abstract = {Surface mass balance ({SMB}) provides mass input to the surface of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and therefore comprises an important control on ice sheet mass balance and resulting contribution to global sea level change. As ice sheet {SMB} varies highly across multiple scales of space (meters to hundreds of kilometers) and time (hourly to decadal), it is notoriously challenging to observe and represent in models. In addition, {SMB} consists of multiple components, all of which depend on complex interactions between the atmosphere and the snow/ice surface, large-scale atmospheric circulation and ocean conditions, and ice sheet topography. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge and recent advances in ice sheet {SMB} observations and models, highlight current shortcomings, and propose future directions. Novel observational methods allow mapping {SMB} across larger areas, longer time periods, and/or at very high (subdaily) temporal frequency. As a recent observational breakthrough, cosmic ray counters provide direct estimates of {SMB}, circumventing the need for accurate snow density observations upon which many other techniques rely. Regional atmospheric climate models have drastically improved their simulation of ice sheet {SMB} in the last decade, thanks to the inclusion or improved representation of essential processes (e.g., clouds, blowing snow, and snow albedo), and by enhancing horizontal resolution (5–30 km). Future modeling efforts are required in improving Earth system models to match regional atmospheric climate model performance in simulating ice sheet {SMB}, and in reinforcing the efforts in developing statistical and dynamic downscaling to represent smaller-scale {SMB} processes.},

However, current atmospheric reanalyses have grid spacings ({\textgreater}25 km) that are too coarse to resolve this variability. To address this limitation, we construct a fine-scale accumulation product from airborne snow radar observations by superimposing along-track fluctuations in accumulation onto an atmospheric reanalysis product. Our resulting airborne product reflects large-scale ({\textgreater}25 km) orographic precipitation patterns while providing robust and unprecedented insight into Antarctic accumulation variability on subgrid scales. On these smaller scales, we find significant, regionally dependent accumulation variability (σrelative{\textgreater}40\%). This variability in accumulation is correlated with variability in topographic surface slope in the wind direction (p{\textless}0.01), confirming that subgrid-scale accumulation variability is driven by snow redistribution by wind.},

It is difficult to determine whether these years of enhanced snowfall are anomalous or part of a longer-term trend, reducing our ability to assess the mitigating impact of snowfall on sea level rise. We determine that the recent snowfall increases in western Queen Maud Land ({QML}) are part of a long-term trend (+5.2 ± 3.7\% decade−1) and are unprecedented over the past two millennia. Warming between 1998 and 2016 is significant and rapid (+1.1 ± 0.7°C decade−1). Using these observations, we determine that the current accumulation and temperature increases in {QML} from an ensemble of global climate simulations are too low, which suggests that projections of the {QML} contribution to sea level rise are potentially overestimated with a reduced mitigating impact of enhanced snowfall in a warming world.},

We analyze current progress and uncertainties in {GRACE} estimates of ice sheet mass balance. We discuss the impacts of errors associated with spherical harmonic truncation, spatial averaging, temporal sampling, and leakage from other time-dependent signals (e.g., glacial isostatic adjustment ({GIA})). The largest sources of error for Antarctica are the {GIA} correction, the omission of l=1 terms, nontidal changes in ocean mass, and measurement errors. For Greenland, the errors come mostly from the uncertainty in the scaling factor. Using Release 5.0 ({RL}05) {GRACE} fields for January 2003 through November 2012, we find a mass change of −258 ± 41 Gt/yr for Greenland, with an acceleration of −31 ± 6 Gt/yr2, and a loss that migrated clockwise around the ice sheet margin to progressively affect the entire periphery. For Antarctica, we report changes of −83 ± 49 and −147 ± 80 Gt/yr for two {GIA} models, with an acceleration of −12 ± 9 Gt/yr2 and a dominance from the southeast pacific sector of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.},

The moving blocks bootstrap is a simple resampling algorithm which can replace parametric time series models, avoiding model selection and only requiring an estimate of the moving block length. The moving blocks bootstrap resamples the observed time series using approximately independent moving blocks. A Monte Carlo experiment is performed involving the use of a time series model to estimate the storage capacity S of a surface water reservoir. Our results document that the bootstrap always produced storage estimates with lower root-mean-square-error than a parametric alternative, even when no model error is introduced into the parametric scheme. These results suggest that the moving blocks bootstrap can provide a simple and attractive alternative to more complex multivariate {ARMA} models.},

Seasonal averages of 700 mb height data are used to illustrate the problem and to demonstrate how the data set properties are taken into account.

The sensitivity (i.e., statistical power) of this approach is potentially compromised both by the discrete nature of the test statistic and by the fact that the approach ignores the confidence with which locally significant tests reject their null hypotheses. An alternative global test statistic that has neither of these problems is the minimum {\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater} value among all of the local tests. Evaluation of field significance using the minimum local {\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater} value as the global test statistic, which is also known as the Walker test, has strong connections to the joint evaluation of multiple tests in a way that controls the “false discovery rate” ({FDR}, or the expected fraction of local null hypothesis rejections that are incorrect). In particular, using the minimum local {\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater} value to evaluate field significance at a level {\textless}em{\textgreater}α{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{global}}$ is nearly equivalent to the slightly more powerful global test based on the {FDR} criterion. An additional advantage shared by Walker’s test and the {FDR} approach is that both are robust to spatial dependence within the field of tests. The {FDR} method not only provides a more broadly applicable and generally more powerful field significance test than the conventional counting procedure but also allows better identification of locations with significant differences, because fewer than {\textless}em{\textgreater}α{\textless}/em{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{global}}$ × 100\% (on average) of apparently significant local tests will have resulted from local null hypotheses that are true.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Because it is infeasible to drill snow cores across all of Antarctica to measure snow density and because it is critical to understand how climatic changes are affecting the world’s largest freshwater reservoir, we develop methods that enable snow density estimation with uncertainty in regions where snow cores have not been drilled. In inland West Antarctica, snow density increases monotonically as a function of depth, except for possible microscale variability or measurement error, and it cannot exceed the density of ice. We present a novel class of integrated spatial process models that allow interpolation of monotone snow density curves. For computational feasibility we construct the space-depth process through kernel convolutions of log-Gaussian spatial processes. We discuss model comparison, model fitting and prediction. Using this model, we extend estimates of snow density beyond the depth of the original core and estimate snow density curves where snow cores have not been drilled. Along flight lines with ice-penetrating radar, we use interpolated snow density curves to estimate recent water accumulation and find predominantly decreasing water accumulation over recent decades.},
